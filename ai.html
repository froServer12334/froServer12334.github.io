            <h1>The rest is questions and answers from me to the AI</h1>

            <h2>What time should I sleep at?</h2>
            <p>The temperature starts to drop significantly around 1 AM, suggesting that your ideal sleep time should begin earlier, likely around 10 PM to align with this natural cooling trend.</p>

            <h2>Given an article [paper] on core temperature and sleep time</h2>
            <p1>I fed it https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK331/</p1>
            <p>Response</p>
            <p>"The coldest hour was identified as 8 AM, and based on the rule of sleeping 2-4 hours before the coldest point, the ideal sleep onset window is calculated to be between 4:00 AM and 6:00 AM.
            </p>

        <h2>With other article</h2>
        <p>I gave it https://www.sleep.com/sleep-health/best-temperature-for-sleeping#:~:text=1.,hours%20before%20you%20wake%20up</p>
        <p>Response</p>
        <p>The lowest average core temperature occurs at 8 AM, so the suggested bedtime is approximately 6 AM, which is 1-2 hours before the nadir. This aligns with the circadian rhythm's natural dip in temperature.</p>

        <h2>Does the pattern match non 24 sleep wake disorder?</h2>
            <p>Progressive delay detected: False</p>
<p>
                The analysis shows that a progressive delay in nadir times is not consistently detected, meaning the pattern does not strongly match Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder.</p>

        <h2>Does the pattern match delayed sleep phase disorder?</h2>
        <p>Consistent delay detected: False</p>
        <p>The pattern does not consistently match DSPD, as the nadir does not reliably occur within the expected delayed time window.</p>

        <h2>what do you think is going on then?</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the analysis, your circadian rhythm appears irregular, with nadir times fluctuating rather than following a consistent delay or progressive shift. This could indicate a disrupted sleep-wake cycle or irregular circadian rhythm,
