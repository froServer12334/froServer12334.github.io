        <h2>How to use the website</h2>

        <p>Please look at the section titled <b>Temperature vs time</b> before you you look at <b>Temperature and sleep
                patterns</b>. The reason being is Temperature vs time shows just my
                temperature data. Your opinion of my sleep pattern may change after looking at the second section. Maybe
            record an observation before and after looking at the charts with sleep data added.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final section is the results I got when feeding data into a research grade AI. Hover over the grey box
            once your done looking at the other 2 sections to see the link for it
        </p>
        <p>
            Every single time I stop melatonin my sleep pattern is different. This time, I seam to sleep a lot more then before however my quality is worsening. To be honest the sleep quality was worsening before I stopped the melatonin.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the past I was sleeping 3 to 4h a night for 2 to 3 out of 10 sleep quality. Now I feal as tho I am sleeping 7+ hours a night yet the sleep is 1 to 2 out of 10. Worse quality and I'm sleeping more. After looking at my sleep graph I see that I am sleeping a lot

        </p>
        <p>
            I also want to note that up until the second last week of November I still felt the effects of selegiline strongly. The last week of november the effect of selegiline began to decline rapidly and my rls returned.
        </p>
        <P>
            All graphs have the same temperature data. Some graphs (listed under section titled Temperature and sleep
            patterns) have sleep patterns attached to them
        </P>
        <P>
            Some webpages may take a minute to load when you first click on them. Each link you click will open in a new
            tab so the home page stays open in the background
        </P>
        <P>
            As this is hosted on github all the code is available to download and should work offline without any
            modification. Please note that it is unoptimized, poorly written and disordered. It's taken me a long time to get this
            far as my cognition fluctuates a lot

        </P>

        <p>
Please read notes on data collected before clicking the graph
        </p>

        <p>Their are also 2 links to 2 images graphing temperature taken orally against the temperature from the medical device</p>



        <p>Once you've interpreted the data, hover over this section with your mouse to see what I think</p>
        <span class="spoiler"> I think my circadian rhythm is dysregulated but at the moment does not show a free running pattern. I think my bedtime should be around 6 am tho I am not even sure I can stabilize that</span>


        <p>Lately their is a section at the bottom of the pages titled "Random Notes" it contains a list of points that
            I've been thinking on</p>


        <h2>Notes on data collected</h2>
        <P>
            For sleep and wake I did not record most short awakings in the night. Most of them were caused by me as for about
            the first week I was taking measurements of temperature under tongue to compare to device. See Oral vs measured temperature
            for the graphs to compare
        </P>

        <P>
            Melatonin was used form the start of the date range (19th of September till the 29th then again on oct 3rd
            and 4th then a final time oct 7th)

The "dataPerDay" website skips empty days where as the dataPerWeek and dataPerWeekStacked pages do not skip any days
        <p>dataPerDay -> each day has it's own scale</p>
        <p>Data per week -> all weeks have the same scale. 7 days per graph where each red line marks the start of a new day and the dotted lines mark noon.</p>
        <p>dataPerWeekStacked -> all weeks the same scale, it's the exact same as data per week but the graphs have been zoomed out and stuck directly on top of each other for better pattern viewing</p>

        <h2>Random Notes</h2>
        <p>When I try single doses of melatonin they don't seam to help me. Only after about 6 weeks of dosing at the same time do I notice it. When it "kicks in", it prevents me from staying up more then 24 hours and I feal "tired" rather then out of energy which what I feel when not on it</p>

        <p>

            I feal as though I've got 2 rhythms in me. Only when they both align I can sleep. It's like my body may be tired but my brain awake or my brian may be tired but my bod's awake. Are their other cycles (systems) that must align for sleep?</p>


        <p>I've always had an affinity towards the night, I'd say when I used to free run 60% of my cycle would skew to night while 40% would skew towards the day. This time since being off melatonin I did not feal that I went round the clock. After looking at my sleep graphs, I see that I did not really go around the clock. Perhaps it was the selegiline  that left changes in my brain, perhaps the results of all the pharmaceuticals I've taken, I am not sure </p>

        <p>How come when I don't take melatonin I often stay awake for more then 24h?</p>

        <p>How is it that I can reset seeping meds? or stay up multiple days on end and while I don't function great I function far better then other people who try to stay up multiple days, and I do so without any stimulants
        </p>

        <p>Seeing as last time I did the DLMO their was melatonin on several points on the graph now both times only the final hour it was detected. It suggests a shift, perhaps I shift really slowly, or, whatever wrong with me has gotten worse</p>

        <p>my grandmas, is 81. She's been sleeping for 3 to 4 hours a night for 22 years. She's got good memory and cognition and is physically active. She's been to doctors and tried 3 sleeping pills. She said they are also water and stopped after the 3 different meds did not help. She's fine with the lack of sleep. She said if she takes a nap during the day she won't sleep at night and some times she can't sleep for over 24h hours but her memory is better then mine. I can not go on 20 more years like this, I don't think I'll know my name.
            I've talked to some geneticists on short sleepers they said they don't even know all the genes associated with it. I explained my grandmas case and they belive her to be a short sleeper. It's possible that I've got part of the mutation where I sleep less but not the restorative bit. Genetic testing was too costly at the time as they would have sequenced the whole genome as their are genes not yet identified with short sleepers. Also that was a few years ago and as mentioned each time I stop melatonin my pattern's different.

            Another notes from the geneticists is that sometimes short sleepers are born with the mutation but the genes aren't expressed. Only a traumatic event causes them to cycle on. For my grandma that was the death of my grandfather, it started the short sleep. That caused me to have a theory, that what if 1/2 of the genes that I may have for short sleep are cycled on leading to less sleep but no better quality? again, does not apply now</p>

        <p>Old notes but no longer the case
            Most people feal more tired as the day goes in. I'm the opposite. I wake up tired and as the day goes on become more awake. It doesn't stop at 3 am it just seams to increase my energy levels till I crash and go to bed my cognition and creativity would also improve throughout the day. Now it's not the case, I'm just simply awake</p>
