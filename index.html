                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Basically this is a moded server and you goal is to destroy as many players as possible. 
                    You are free to do anything you want to so long as it doesn’t break the rules. I recommend setting up a base of operations to
                    craft advanced armour and weapons. LagGoggles has been installed on this server to help you and the admin monitor lag. The config and mod files can be found at the bottom of the page.  Also, it’s free to play.
                </p>
           

            <h1>Rules:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Only use opaque item and fluid ducts</li>
                <li>Max of 24 field Distance upgrades ( in the force field projector) and a max of 2 MFFS projector per person, they aren’t supposed to protect your entire base just a few kay places</li>
                <li>Max of 5 turrets per player</li>
                <li>Basic server rules like to cheating, no hacking, no lag machines, ect</li>

                <li>Please Note: If you are crating too much lag you will get a waring and allotted a day or two to fix it</li>
                <li>Please Note: Failure to follow these rules may result in your base being deleted or opened up to raiders, being banned from the server and having your account reported to Microsoft. AKA, don’t be stupid.</li>

                <h1>Notes (and buffs):</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure you have allotted 6Gb of ram to Minecraft</li>
                    <li>Make sure you mod and config folders match</li>
                    <li>Before you play on the server I recommend that you play around in a creative world for a little while until you get a feal for the mods</li>
                    <li>Player trading in encouraged</li>
                    <li>It costs 10 xp to use the teleporter but you can teleport anywhere in the world</li>
                    <li>If you try to rotate a barrel with a hammer it’s contents may get deleted</li>
                    <li>It’s recommended to exit and rejoin the server when using a telepad.</li>
                    <li>Before you set up a shield around your base make sure they you have at least a telepad to get back in. If you do lock your self out the server admins will let you back in but they will post the quadrants of your base to chat (and /  or a website or discord server – it’s still undecided).</li>
                    <li>There will be occasional sales in the server shops and other updates that may require you to download more content</li>
                    <li>The Mega Torch will block spawn with in a 64 block radius of the torch and will never burn out</li>
                    <li>Each player starts with $100</li>
                 </ul>

                 <h1>Installation and troubleshooting:</h1>
                 <p>I recommend that you set a lot at 6 Gb of ram to Minecraft and have a dedicated GPU. You could get away with 4Gb and using integrated graphics but it’s not recommended. I also recommend that you use 64-bit Java. You will also need to make sure that your mods and config folders match. I recommend that you use Multi Mc, it allows you to keep your installations separate. Note: If you bought Minecraft with a Microsoft account, you wont be able to use Multi Mc (they are working on migrating accounts so you should be able to use it in the future).</p>
                 <h2>Note: For the tutorials below make sure you use Minecraft version 1.12.2, allocate 6Gb of RAM, install Forge version 1.12.2 - 14.23.5.2854 and use the mod and config files provided below
                   The config file is not 100% required as your config files will update automatically when connected to the server, you will just need to restart your game.
